= Downloads
#? should write 'nonrel_*' as extension, or provide extension names?
#? pk detection more than model.default_manager.pk, I recall
#? size limitations on download
#? model class not enforced on download
#? bulk saving
#? MIMEs are plain/text for page downloads (wrong)
#? remove 'model in filename' option, or use app name?

= Upload Deserializers
#? enable ignorenonexistent
#? popnone, or not
#! yes, want a forced must-deal-with this format/mime/class
#? Createview needs more fexible messages

= Serializers
#? XML to python bases, like other serializers
#? remove natural_pk

= General
#! the pk issue, eliminate on download/upload, where and to what effect?
#? Admin protection
#? check charsets
#? allow args to parsers (e.g 'dialect' to CSV dictwriter)
#? redirect or something on DownloadView


Handle relational fields if possible, otherwise 
Serialize - error
Deserialize - maybe ignore
(Means overriding base to throw error on natural key stuff too)
