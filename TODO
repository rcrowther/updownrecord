Need a rethink here:

Handle relational fields if possible, otherwise 
Serialize - error
Deserialize - maybe ignore
(Means overriding base to throw error on natural key stuff too)

CSV and FreeCFG can not use Python (it does the fields thing)?
Deserialize will not work for dicts, uses objects?
ignorenonexistent is Python Deserialize attribute

ignorenonexistent on everthing

need new base for protection against non-relative fields
therefor need new Python for non-relative fields.
